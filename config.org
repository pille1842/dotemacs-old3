#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Eric Haberstroh
#+EMAIL: gpg@erixpage.de
#+STARTUP: indent

* Introduction
This is the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] configuration file of Eric Haberstroh
<[[mailto:gpg@erixpage.de][gpg@erixpage.de]]>.

The entire configuration lives within this [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] file.  On startup,
the following =init.el= file will load the Org library, extract all
Emacs Lisp source code blocks from this file and execute them:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (require 'org)
  (org-babel-load-file (concat user-emacs-directory "config.org"))
#+END_SRC

You can find the source code of this configuration as well as its
project history on [[https://github.com/pille1842/dotemacs/][GitHub]].  A readable HTML version is stored on
[[http://www.erixpage.de/dotemacs/][Erixpage.de]].

This configuration has been tested with GNU Emacs version 26.1 on a
64-bit Ubuntu MATE 18.04 system.  Emacs has been compiled with the
following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  ./configure --with-mailutils --with-xwidgets
  make
  sudo make install
#+END_SRC

Most of the compilation requirements can be installed as dependencies
for building Emacs 25.  Some additional libraries and programs have
been installed.  The following commands should suffice to make
compilation of Emacs possible:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  sudo apt-get build-dep emacs25
  sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libsystemd-dev mailutils
#+END_SRC

In the following sections of this document, a variety of configuration
settings are made that fit my personal taste.  While it is certainly
possible to use this configuration in its whole, I would encourage you
to instead pick the parts of it that fit your personal style.

Questions and comments are welcome at [[mailto:gpg@erixpage.de][gpg@erixpage.de]] or the [[https://github.com/pille1842/dotemacs/issues/][GitHub
issue tracker]].

* Disable the customization system
I do not wish to use Emacs' built-in customization interface.  I would
also like to keep my init file clean from its ugly insertions.
Therefore let's define a custom file and then proceed to ignore it
forever.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory "custom.el"))
#+END_SRC

* Package system
This configuration relies on the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] macro.  In order for the
configuration to be portable, use-package will be installed if it is
not already present.  So first, let's initialize the package system,
including the [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]] package archive.  Then let's check if use-package
is installed and install it if necessary.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)

  (let* ((no-ssl (and (memq system-type '(windows-nt ms-dos))
                      (not (gnutls-available-p))))
         (proto (if no-ssl "http" "https")))
    (when no-ssl
      (warn "\
  Your version of Emacs does not support SSL connections,
  which is unsafe because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks.
  There are two things you can do about this warning:
  1. Install an Emacs version that does support SSL and be safe.
  2. Remove this warning from your init file so you won't see it again."))
    ;; Comment/uncomment these two lines to enable/disable MELPA and MELPA Stable as desired
    (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa" (concat proto "://melpa.org/packages/")) t)
    ;;(add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa-stable" (concat proto "://stable.melpa.org/packages/")) t)
    (when (< emacs-major-version 24)
      ;; For important compatibility libraries like cl-lib
      (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "gnu" (concat proto "://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))))
  (package-initialize)

  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'use-package))
#+END_SRC

Now let's load use-package.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (eval-when-compile
    (require 'use-package))
#+END_SRC

Similarly to what we did above with use-package itself, use-package
can ensure that any packages we select in this configuration will be
installed if they are not already present on the local system.  This
can either be done for each package separately via the =:ensure t=
option, or it can be enabled for all packages, which is what I prefer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+END_SRC

* Backups
Instead of cluttering the file system with backup files ending in =~=,
I prefer Emacs to save all backups in a central directory.  The
following settings, taking directly from [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BackupDirectory][EmacsWiki]], accomplishes that.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-by-copying t
        backup-directory-alist
        '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/backup/"))
        delete-old-versions t
        kept-new-versions 6
        kept-old-versions 2
        version-control t)
#+END_SRC

* Interface
** Change frame title
I usually only use one Emacs frame.  The title of that frame should
therefore just be "Emacs".

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq frame-title-format "Emacs")
#+END_SRC

** Disable tool-bar and scroll-bar
Disable the ugly tool-bar at the top and the unnecessary scroll-bar at
the right edge of the frame.  While I seldomly use the menu-bar, it
can still be useful sometimes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

** Inhibit splash screen and set initial scratch message
By default, Emacs shows a welcome screen on startup.  I would prefer
to see the scratch buffer instead.  A welcoming message can be
displayed there instead.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-splash-screen t
        initial-scratch-message
        (concat ";; Welcome to Emacs "
                emacs-version
                " on "
                (system-name)
                ".\n\n"))
#+END_SRC

** Theme and font
By default, Emacs uses the Ubuntu font family on my system.  I prefer
[[https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro][Source Code Pro]], a free Adobe font.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Source Code Pro 12"))
#+END_SRC

The default theme is a little too bright for my taste.  Let's use
[[https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs][Zenburn]] instead.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package zenburn-theme
    :config
    (load-theme 'zenburn t))
#+END_SRC

** Show column number in modeline
By default, Emacs only displays the current line number in the
modeline.  I much prefer to see which column I'm in, too.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (column-number-mode t)
#+END_SRC

** Helm
[[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][Helm]], in its own words, "is an Emacs framework for incremental
completions and narrowing selections."

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm
    :bind (("M-x"     . helm-M-x)
           ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files))
    :config
    (require 'helm-config)
    (helm-mode t))
#+END_SRC

* Editing
** Electric pairs
Why type parentheses yourself when there is [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElectricPair][Electric Pair mode]]?  Let's
enable it globally.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (electric-pair-mode t)
#+END_SRC

** Highlight matching parens
Especially in Lisp code, finding the right balance of parentheses is
key.  This mode helps.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (show-paren-mode t)
#+END_SRC

* Source control
** Magit
[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is an interface to the version control system [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]], implemented
as an Emacs package.

The [[https://magit.vc/manual/magit.html][user manual]] recommends setting up some keybindings and enabling a
global minor mode with some bindings for all file-visiting buffers.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :bind (("C-x g"   . magit-status)
           ("C-x M-g" . magit-dispatch-popup))
    :config
    (global-magit-file-mode t))
#+END_SRC

* Programming
The following subsections set up Emacs to support a variety of
programming languages and related file formats which I use.

** PHP
The following setup is largely based on [[http://www.blogbyben.com/2016/08/emacs-php-modern-and-far-more-complete.html][this blog post]] by Ben Simon.

First, let's define a function to set up a reasonable environment for
PHP coding, including indentation with four spaces (and no TABs!).
Since I will be using web-mode for non-PHP files including template
files that contain PHP code, php-mode will not need to care about
HTML.

We'll also pull in [[https://github.com/xcwen/ac-php][ac-php]] for aggressive autocompletion.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ac-php
    :config
    (auto-complete-mode t)
    (require 'ac-php)
    (setq ac-sources '(ac-source-php))
    (yas-global-mode t)
    (ac-php-core-eldoc-setup))

  (defun eh/setup-php-mode ()
    "Set up indentation and other bits and pieces for PHP files."
    (setq indent-tabs-mode nil
          c-basic-offset 4
          php-template-compatibility nil)
    (subword-mode t))
#+END_SRC

Then, let's install [[https://github.com/emacs-php/php-mode][php-mode]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package php-mode
    :config
    (require 'php-ext)
    (add-hook 'php-mode-hook 'eh/setup-php-mode))
#+END_SRC

Templates, CSS files and other related web files will be excellently
handled by [[http://web-mode.org/][web-mode]].

Again, let's define a setup function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun eh/setup-web-mode ()
    "Set up indentation and other bits and pieces for web-mode."
    (setq indent-tabs-mode nil
          web-mode-markup-indent-offset 4
          web-mode-css-indent-offset 4
          web-mode-code-indent-offset 4)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
                 '("\\.tpl\\'" . web-mode)))
#+END_SRC

Then let's pull in the package.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package web-mode
    :config
    (add-hook 'web-mode-hook 'eh/setup-web-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Load a private configuration file
Some settings may need to reside in a private file that is kept
outside source control.  The constant =private-file= is defined to
contain the path to such a file.  If it exists, it will be loaded at
the end of the startup process.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defconst private-file (concat user-emacs-directory "private.el")
    "A private initialization file that is kept outside of source
  control and is loaded at the very end of the startup process.")

  (when (file-readable-p private-file)
    (load-file private-file))
#+END_SRC
