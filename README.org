This repository contains my configuration files for GNU Emacs.

[[https://github.com/pille1842/dotemacs/blob/master/screenshot.png]]

** Setup
There are two files where the actual configuration takes place:

- [[https://github.com/pille1842/dotemacs/blob/master/init.el][init.el]] will be loaded by Emacs at startup.  It bootstraps the
  packaging system, then loads the actual configuration from...
- [[https://github.com/pille1842/dotemacs/blob/master/config.org][config.org]], where most configuration operations are performed.

Refer to =config.org= for instructions on how to build Emacs in a
manner compatible with this configuration.  It should reasonably work
with any newer Emacs version, but has only been tested with GNU Emacs
26.1 on Ubuntu MATE 18.04 systems.

You may need to install the [[https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro][Source Code Pro]] family of fonts on your
system if you haven't done so already.  If you wish to use a different
font, refer to the "Interface / Theme and font" section in
=config.org= and put your choice there.

If you wish to use this configuration in its entirety, begin by making
a backup of your existing configuration files if necessary:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
cp ~/.emacs{,.bak}
mv ~/.emacs.d{,.bak}
#+END_SRC

Then clone this repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
git clone https://github.com/pille1842/dotemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

On first start, Emacs should automatically refresh its knowledge of
the GNU ELPA, MELPA and Orgmode.org ELPA, then install a whole bunch
of packages.  I would recommend restarting Emacs after the
installation is finished.

** The private file
The repository is configured via =.gitignore= to only contain this
README, the =.gitignore= itself, =init.el= and =config.org=.  This is
to protect you from accidentally committing sensible information like
your bookmarks, recently visited files or any other content you do not
wish to share on public platforms.

In particular, you might want to create a file called =private.el= in
=~/.emacs.d=.  If this file exists, it will be loaded at the end of
the configuration process.  You might want to put any personal
information or settings which you do not wish to commit into the
repository in this file.
